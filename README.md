# Stochastic Performance Logic evaluation engine

Stochastice Performance Logic is a formalism for capturing performance
assumptions.
It is, for example, possible to capture assumption that newer version of
a function `bar` is faster than the previous version or that library
`foobar` is faster than library `barfoo` when rendering antialiased text.

This repository contains an implementation for evaluation of the SPL
formulas.
That is, you would use this library when you have your performance measured
(or modeled) and you need to evaluate whether your assumptions are correct.


## Requirements

To compile and run the framework, the following software has to be available
on your machine.

* Java SDK >= 1.8.0
* Maven


## Compilation

Simply execute

```{.sh}
$ mvn package
```


to compile the program. For creating `.jar` package and add it to local Maven repository run

```{.sh}
$ mvn install
```

Resulting file is `target/spl-evaluation-java-1.0.0.jar`.

All the generated files (classes, test reports) are stored in the `target/`
directory.


## Usage

There are several command-line options. Quick help is printed on error (for example when no argument is given).

```
usage: spl-evaluation-java [-c <formulas>] -d <data_directory> [-f
       <formula_file>] [-j <benchmarks.jar>] [-p] [-r <mapping_file>]
Evaluate measured data against SPL formulas.
 -c,--commandline-formulas <formulas>   Read SPL formulas from commandline
                                        arguments.
 -d,--data-dir <data_directory>         Path to directory with measured
                                        data.
 -f,--file-formulas <formula_file>      Read SPL formulas from text file.
 -j,--jar-formulas <benchmarks.jar>     Read SPL formulas from JAR file.
 -p,--print-unknown                     Print unknown revisions and exit.
 -r,--revision-mapping <mapping_file>   Mapping of formula revisions to
                                        file names.
```

SPL formulas can be specified in 3 ways - inside `benchmarks.jar`, in text file or directly on command-line.
Formulas are parsed in this order, latter has higher priority and will override previous formulas.

- `benchmarks.jar` - formulas are saved in META-INF/SPLFormulas file formatted as `benchmark_name:formula`.
  This file is generated via corresponding maven plugin (jmh_spl-maven-plugin) from `@SPLFormula` annotations.
- text file - simple text file formatted as `benchmark_name:formula`
- command-line arguments - list of values `benchmark_name:formula` separated by space. Note that enclosing each
  value into `"` symbols may be required because of shell argument parsing.
  
**print-unknown** option prints versions, that are mentioned in SPL formulas but are not present in measured data
 or transitively in custom mapping of revisions. No evaluation is performed. Empty rows or rows starting with
 `#` are ignored.
 
**revision-mapping** is simple text file with `:` separated values of custom revision and actual measured data revision.
 Each line contains one mapping, empty rows or rows starting with `#` are ignored.
 
### Example

```{.sh}
$ java -jar spl-evaluation-java.jar -d ./demo-data/jmh -r /tmp/mapping.txt -j ./target/benchmarks.jar -c "cz.stdin.ps.MyBenchmark.testMethod:last < ver2" "cz.stdin.ps.MyBenchmark.methodTwo:ver1 < base"
```


## Tests

The attached unit tests can be compiled and executed by running

```{.sh}
$ mvn test
```

## Documentation

... is not very detailed at the moment.

Running `mvn site` will generate JavaDoc documentation with basic information
on how to use this evaluation engine, unit test report and detailed project summary.
To see it, open `target/site/index.html` in your browser.

SPL was originally created for performance unit testing, more information
is available at [SPL for Java page](http://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/software/spl-java)
at [Department of Distributed and Dependable Systems](http://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/)
([Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague](http://mff.cuni.cz/)).

## Demos

Examples of how to use this project as a library are located in `src/demo/` directory. It contains separate `pom.xml`
file to build them. **Note**, that the parent project must be installed in local Maven repository prior building demos
(via `mvn install` command).

There are currently two prepared scenarios, which can be run directly from Maven:
- `mvn exec:java@regression-tester`
- `mvn exec:java@sensitivity-comparison`
